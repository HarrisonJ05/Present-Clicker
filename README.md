Santa Clicker

This is a very original game (no inspiration from cookie clicker whatsoever).

Essentially, you click santa to get presents. With those presents you can upgrade your click. With an upgraded click you get more presents and so on...

To begin, you are going to want to create a new account. Enter a username and password, then refresh the page.
Next you want to login to your account using the same username and password.
Then begin clicking.
The live leaderboard on the side is reading from a database with all users so you can see where you fair in comparison to other users (there are countless users playing this game)
Whenever you want to log off, make sure to press save to store your progress for when you log back in next time.
